The application requires no configuration files. All settings are adjustable through the UI:

Clustering: Adjust number of clusters (2-10)

Classification: Choose from 4 algorithms

Visualization: Select columns and chart types

Performance
Typical performance metrics:

Operation	Time Complexity	Notes
Data Loading	O(n)	Scales with file size
Clustering	O(n*k*i)	n=samples, k=clusters, i=iterations
Classification	Varies by algorithm	Random Forest typically slowest
